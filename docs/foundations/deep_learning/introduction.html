      <h2>Understanding Deep Learning</h2>

      <p>
        Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on neural networks
        composed of multiple layers.
      </p>

      <p>
        While classical machine learning primarily focuses on structured data,
        deep learning is designed to handle complex, high-dimensional inputs
        such as images, text, and audio.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its strength lies in automatic feature extraction and representation learning.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>How It Differs from Classical ML</h2>

      <p>Key differences include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Automatic feature learning instead of manual feature engineering</li>
        <li>Dependence on larger datasets</li>
        <li>Use of neural network architectures</li>
        <li>Optimization via gradient-based learning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Deep learning models are highly flexible,
        but they are also more computationally demanding.
      </p>
