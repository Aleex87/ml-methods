# Deep Learning Foundations

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning
based on neural networks with multiple layers.

While classical machine learning focuses primarily on structured data,
deep learning is designed to handle more complex and high-dimensional data,
such as images, text, and audio.

This section introduces the core concepts required
to understand how deep learning models work.

# How Deep Learning Differs from Classical ML

Classical Machine Learning:

- Often works well with tabular data
- Requires manual feature engineering
- Uses predefined algorithms

Deep Learning:

- Learns features automatically
- Requires larger datasets
- Uses neural network architectures
- Relies heavily on optimization through gradient descent

Deep learning models are typically more flexible,
but also more computationally demanding.
