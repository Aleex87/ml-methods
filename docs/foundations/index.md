# Machine Learning Lab

This project is a structured learning lab focused on understanding machine learning models from the ground up.

The goal is not only to run models, but to understand:
- how they work
- when to use them
- how to evaluate them
- how to organize a real machine learning project

## Classical Machine Learning

Classical machine learning models are based on well-defined algorithms and are widely used for structured data.

### Regression
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
- Random Forest Regression

### Classification
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
- Random Forest Classification

## Deep Learning

Deep learning models are based on neural networks and are designed to learn complex patterns from data.

- Neural Networks fundamentals
- PyTorch models
- TensorFlow / Keras models

## Foundations

Before diving into specific models, it is important to understand the fundamental concepts behind machine learning.

- General Concepts
- Classical Machine Learning Foundations
