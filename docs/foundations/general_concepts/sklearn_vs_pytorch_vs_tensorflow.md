# Scikit-learn vs PyTorch vs TensorFlow

Machine learning projects require not only algorithms,
but also tools to implement them.

Several frameworks are available,
each designed for different purposes.

The most widely used are:

- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow

Understanding their differences helps in choosing the right tool.

# Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is primarily designed for classical machine learning.

It is best suited for:

- Structured (tabular) data
- Regression and classification problems
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction

Strengths:

- Simple and consistent API
- Easy to use
- Excellent for beginners
- Fast prototyping

Limitations:

- Not designed for deep neural networks
- Limited flexibility for custom architectures

Scikit-learn is ideal for most traditional ML tasks.

# PyTorch

PyTorch is a deep learning framework
focused on flexibility and research.

It is commonly used for:

- Neural networks
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Research experiments

Strengths:

- Dynamic computation graph
- High flexibility
- Intuitive debugging
- Strong research community

PyTorch is often preferred in academic and research environments.

---

# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a deep learning framework
designed for scalability and production deployment.

It is commonly used for:

- Large-scale deep learning systems
- Production-ready models
- Distributed training

Strengths:

- Strong deployment ecosystem
- Integration with TensorFlow Serving and TFLite
- High scalability

TensorFlow is often chosen for industrial applications.

# Conceptual Differences

Scikit-learn:
- Focuses on classical ML
- Works mostly with NumPy arrays
- Provides ready-to-use algorithms

PyTorch and TensorFlow:
- Focus on neural networks
- Require explicit model definition
- Use automatic differentiation
- Support GPU acceleration

---

# When to Use Each Framework

Use Scikit-learn when:
- Working with tabular data
- Solving regression or classification problems
- Rapid prototyping is needed

Use PyTorch when:
- Building custom neural networks
- Conducting research
- Needing flexibility

Use TensorFlow when:
- Deploying models at scale
- Building production systems
- Working in enterprise environments

---

# Key Takeaway

The choice of framework depends on:

- The type of problem
- The scale of the project
- Deployment requirements
- Desired flexibility

There is no universally superior framework.

Each tool serves a specific purpose within the machine learning ecosystem.
