# General Machine Learning Concepts

Before training any model, it is essential to understand the broader context
in which machine learning operates.

This section introduces fundamental ideas that apply to all machine learning approaches,
whether classical or deep learning.

These concepts define how projects begin,
how data is handled,
and how modeling decisions are made.

# The Logical Starting Point

Machine learning does not begin with algorithms.

It begins with:

1. Understanding the data
2. Defining the learning objective
3. Preparing the dataset
4. Selecting the appropriate tools

Without this foundation, model selection becomes arbitrary.

# What This Section Covers

This section explains:

- The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- How real-world datasets are loaded and structured
- The importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- How machine learning frameworks differ and when to use them

These topics apply to every machine learning project.

# From Data to Tools

A complete workflow requires:

- Data understanding (EDA)
- Proper dataset loading and preprocessing
- Clear definition of the prediction target
- Selection of the appropriate framework

Different frameworks serve different purposes:

- **Scikit-learn** is widely used for classical machine learning on structured data.
- **PyTorch** is flexible and research-oriented, commonly used in deep learning.
- **TensorFlow** is scalable and production-oriented, often used for deployment and large systems.

Understanding these differences helps in making informed technical decisions.

# Why This Matters

In controlled examples, data is often clean and ready to use.

In real-world applications:

- data must be downloaded or extracted
- formats vary
- preprocessing is required
- the prediction target may need to be defined
- framework choice affects development strategy

Strong foundational knowledge prevents inefficient experimentation.

# Connection to the Rest of the Project

The concepts in this section prepare you to:

- move into Classical Machine Learning foundations
- understand Deep Learning workflows
- approach model development systematically

They establish the reasoning process that comes before implementation.

# Learning Objective

After completing this section, you should be able to:

- identify the type of learning problem
- understand how datasets are structured
- perform exploratory data analysis
- load real-world data responsibly
- select appropriate machine learning tools

These skills form the starting point of any serious machine learning project.
