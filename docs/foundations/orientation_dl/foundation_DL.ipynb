    "Even though different frameworks are used\n",
    "(scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow),\n",
    "the **logical structure of the notebook remains identical**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees:\n",
    "- conceptual consistency\n",
    "- fair comparison between models\n",

    "## Overview of the Deep Learning notebooks in this project\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is introduced progressively,\n",
    "using multiple frameworks and problem types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. scikit-learn (high-level, abstracted)\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with scikit-learn to focus on **concepts**, not implementation.\n",

    "- Deep Learning – Classification (MLPClassifier)\n",
    "- Deep Learning – Regression (MLPRegressor)\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks:\n",
    "- use the same API style as classical ML\n",
    "- hide training loops and gradients\n",
    "- act as a bridge to full DL frameworks\n",

    "- we explicitly define the model\n",
    "- we write the training loop\n",
    "- we control loss, gradients, and optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch uses **eager execution by default**,\n",
    "which makes it intuitive and debugger-friendly.\n",
