      <h2>Understanding Classical Machine Learning</h2>

      <p>
        Classical machine learning focuses primarily on structured and tabular data.
        These models rely on clearly defined mathematical formulations
        and are widely used in real-world production systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike deep learning, classical ML typically requires
        manual feature engineering and careful preprocessing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite their simplicity compared to neural networks,
        these models remain powerful, efficient, and interpretable.
      </p>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Core Characteristics</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Works efficiently with structured datasets</li>
        <li>Requires explicit feature preparation</li>
        <li>Often computationally lightweight</li>
        <li>Highly interpretable in many cases</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Classical models provide strong baselines and are often preferred
        when interpretability and efficiency are priorities.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Core Topics Covered</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Regression vs Classification problems</li>
        <li>Feature scaling and data splitting</li>
        <li>Evaluation metrics and performance interpretation</li>
        <li>Overfitting, underfitting, and generalization</li>
        <li>Bias–variance tradeoff</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These principles apply across most traditional machine learning algorithms,
        including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression,
        K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.

      <h2>Why Classical ML Still Matters</h2>

      <p>
        While deep learning dominates high-dimensional tasks,
        classical machine learning remains highly relevant.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fast training and inference</li>
        <li>Lower hardware requirements</li>
        <li>Clear interpretability</li>
        <li>Strong performance on tabular data</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In many structured-data scenarios,
        classical models outperform complex neural architectures.
