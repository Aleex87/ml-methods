# Classical Machine Learning Foundations

Classical Machine Learning focuses on structured data and well-defined predictive tasks.

This section introduces the core theoretical concepts required to understand
how traditional machine learning models work.

Before implementing models such as:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

it is essential to understand the principles behind them.

# What This Section Covers

This section explains:

- The difference between regression and classification
- How model performance is evaluated
- The meaning of overfitting and underfitting
- The role of bias and variance
- Why feature scaling and data splitting are necessary

These concepts apply to most classical ML algorithms.

# Why Classical ML Matters

Classical machine learning models:

- are efficient on structured/tabular data
- require less computational power than deep learning
- are often more interpretable
- remain widely used in real-world applications

They form the foundation upon which more advanced techniques are built.
