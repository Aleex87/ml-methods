    "\n",
    "As with the other classification notebooks,\n",
    "the first sections focus on data preparation\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be read **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not just to run the code,\n",
    "but to understand how **deep learning models**\n",
    "fit into the supervised learning pipeline\n",
    "and how they differ from classical machine learning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Deep Learning (in this context)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning refers to a class of models\n",
    "based on **neural networks with multiple layers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are designed to:\n",
    "- learn complex, non-linear relationships\n",
    "- automatically build internal representations\n",
    "- go beyond hand-crafted features\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on:\n",
    "**Deep Learning for tabular data**\n",
    "using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use scikit-learn for Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn provides a **high-level abstraction**\n",
    "for neural networks through `MLPClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to:\n",
    "- focus on concepts rather than low-level details\n",
    "- reuse the same pipeline as classical ML models\n",
    "- understand *what* deep learning does\n",
    "  before learning *how* it is implemented internally\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook acts as a **conceptual bridge**\n",
    "between classical machine learning\n",
    "and full deep learning frameworks\n",
    "such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "With Deep Learning (scikit-learn), you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "- improved performance on complex patterns\n",
    "- higher sensitivity to feature scaling\n",
    "- longer training times compared to linear models\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- interpretability is lower\n",
    "- hyperparameter tuning becomes more important\n",
    "- the model behaves as a black box\n",
