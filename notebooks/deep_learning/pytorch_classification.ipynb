    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to scikit-learn,\n",
    "this notebook exposes **more internal details**\n",
    "of how a Deep Learning model is trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not only to run the code,\n",
    "but to understand **what happens during training**\n",
    "and how neural networks learn step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Deep Learning (in this context)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning refers to a class of models\n",
    "based on **neural networks with multiple layers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are designed to:\n",
    "- learn complex, non-linear relationships\n",
    "- build internal representations of the data\n",
    "- improve performance as data complexity increases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on:\n",
    "**Deep Learning for tabular classification**\n",
    "using fully connected neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a **low-level deep learning framework**\n",
    "that provides explicit control over:\n",
    "\n",
    "- model architecture\n",
    "- forward pass\n",
    "- loss computation\n",
    "- backpropagation\n",
    "- parameter updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike scikit-learn:\n",
    "- nothing is hidden\n",
    "- every step must be defined explicitly\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes PyTorch ideal for:\n",
    "- learning how neural networks actually work\n",
    "- understanding gradient-based optimization\n",
    "- experimenting with custom architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution model: eager execution\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch uses **eager execution** by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- operations are executed immediately\n",
    "- tensors behave like regular Python objects\n",
    "- debugging is straightforward\n",
    "\n",
    "Eager execution makes PyTorch:\n",
    "- intuitive to learn\n",
    "- flexible to experiment with\n",
    "- closer to the mathematical description of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "With Deep Learning (PyTorch), you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "- strong performance on complex data\n",
    "- behavior similar to scikit-learn neural networks\n",
    "- higher transparency during training\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- more code is required\n",
    "- implementation errors are easier to make\n",
    "- careful design is necessary\n",
