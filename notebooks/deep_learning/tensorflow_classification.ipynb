    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be read **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to PyTorch,\n",
    "this notebook hides more low-level details,\n",
    "allowing us to focus on **model structure and behavior**\n",
    "rather than training mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Deep Learning (in this context)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning refers to models based on\n",
    "**multi-layer neural networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models:\n",
    "- learn complex, non-linear relationships\n",
    "- automatically build internal representations\n",
    "- improve performance as data complexity increases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on:\n",
    "**Deep Learning for tabular classification**\n",
    "using fully connected neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why TensorFlow / Keras?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow / Keras provides:\n",
    "- a high-level API for defining neural networks\n",
    "- automatic training loops\n",
    "- built-in loss functions and optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to:\n",
    "- write less code\n",
    "- reduce implementation errors\n",
    "- focus on architecture and results\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is ideal for:\n",
    "- rapid prototyping\n",
    "- production-ready models\n",
    "- clean and readable implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution model: eager and graph\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow supports two execution modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eager execution**  \n",
    "  Operations are executed immediately,\n",
    "  similar to standard Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph execution**  \n",
    "  Computation is compiled into a static graph\n",
    "  for optimized performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras abstracts this complexity,\n",
    "allowing us to work intuitively\n",
    "while benefiting from optimized execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "With Deep Learning (TensorFlow / Keras), you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- performance comparable to PyTorch\n",
    "- clean and compact model definitions\n",
    "- faster experimentation\n",
    "- less control over low-level training details\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- debugging is less explicit than PyTorch\n",
    "- internal mechanics are more hidden\n",
    "- understanding requires conceptual clarity\n",

    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** provides a global measure\n",

    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix shows:\n",
    "- correct predictions\n",
    "- false positives\n",
    "- false negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to understand\n",
