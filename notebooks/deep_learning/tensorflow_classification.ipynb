    "# Deep Learning – Classification (TensorFlow / Keras)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of the **ML-Methods** project.\n",
    "\n",
    "It introduces **Deep Learning for supervised classification**\n",
    "using **TensorFlow / Keras**, a high-level deep learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the other classification notebooks,\n",
    "the first sections focus on data preparation\n",
    "and are intentionally repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures consistency across models\n",
    "and allows fair comparison of results.\n",

    "## How this notebook should be read\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be read **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to PyTorch,\n",
    "this notebook hides more low-level details,\n",
    "allowing us to focus on **model structure and behavior**\n",
    "rather than training mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Deep Learning (in this context)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning refers to models based on\n",
    "**multi-layer neural networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models:\n",
    "- learn complex, non-linear relationships\n",
    "- automatically build internal representations\n",
    "- improve performance as data complexity increases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on:\n",
    "**Deep Learning for tabular classification**\n",
    "using fully connected neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why TensorFlow / Keras?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow / Keras provides:\n",
    "- a high-level API for defining neural networks\n",
    "- automatic training loops\n",
    "- built-in loss functions and optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to:\n",
    "- write less code\n",
    "- reduce implementation errors\n",
    "- focus on architecture and results\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is ideal for:\n",
    "- rapid prototyping\n",
    "- production-ready models\n",
    "- clean and readable implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution model: eager and graph\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow supports two execution modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eager execution**  \n",
    "  Operations are executed immediately,\n",
    "  similar to standard Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph execution**  \n",
    "  Computation is compiled into a static graph\n",
    "  for optimized performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras abstracts this complexity,\n",
    "allowing us to work intuitively\n",
    "while benefiting from optimized execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "With Deep Learning (TensorFlow / Keras), you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- performance comparable to PyTorch\n",
    "- clean and compact model definitions\n",
    "- faster experimentation\n",
    "- less control over low-level training details\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- debugging is less explicit than PyTorch\n",
    "- internal mechanics are more hidden\n",
    "- understanding requires conceptual clarity\n",
    "\n",
