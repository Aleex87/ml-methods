    "This notebook is part of the **ML-Methods** project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first sections focus on data preparation\n",

    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not just to run the code,\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of predicting a continuous value,\n",
    "Logistic Regression predicts the **probability**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why we start with intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression looks similar to Linear Regression,\n",
    "but it behaves very differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this difference early\n",
    "helps avoid confusion when reading the code\n",

    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "With Logistic Regression, you should expect:\n",
    "- probabilistic outputs\n",
    "- linear decision boundaries\n",
    "- strong performance on linearly separable data\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often used as:\n",
    "- a baseline classification model\n",
    "- a simple and interpretable solution\n",
    "- a reference point for more complex classifiers\n",
