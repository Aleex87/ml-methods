    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of the **ML-Methods** project.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the other classification notebooks,\n",
    "the first sections focus on data preparation\n",
    "and are intentionally repeated.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be read **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not just to run the code,\n",
    "but to understand what is happening at each step\n",

    "## What is Random Forest Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Classification is an **ensemble classification model**\n",
    "that combines the predictions of many decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying on a single classifier,\n",
    "Random Forest aggregates the decisions\n",
    "of multiple independent models\n",
    "to produce a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we start with intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest may look complex,\n",
    "but its core idea is simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each decision tree makes a prediction.\n",
    "Some trees make mistakes,\n",
    "but many trees together tend to agree\n",
    "on the correct class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this idea of\n",
    "**many weak classifiers working together**\n",
    "is key to understanding Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "With Random Forest Classification, you should expect:\n",
    "- strong performance on non-linear problems\n",
    "- robustness to noise and outliers\n",
    "- stable predictions without heavy tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- interpretability is lower than linear models\n",
    "- training and memory usage are higher\n",
