    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be read **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",

    "## What is Random Forest Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regression is a powerful and flexible model\n",
    "that works very differently from both Linear Regression and KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of learning a single global rule\n",
    "or relying on nearby data points,\n",
    "Random Forest builds **many decision trees**\n",
    "and combines their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree:\n",
    "- looks at the data in a slightly different way\n",
    "- makes its own prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The final prediction is obtained by:\n",
    "- averaging the predictions of all trees\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining many simple models,\n",
    "Random Forest is able to capture complex and non-linear patterns\n",
    "that simpler models cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we start with intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest can look complex at first,\n",
    "but the core idea is simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trusting a single model,\n",
    "Random Forest asks the same question many times,\n",
    "each time with a slightly different perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree may make mistakes,\n",
    "but when many trees agree,\n",
    "the final prediction becomes more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this idea of **many weak models working together**\n",
    "is key to understanding how Random Forest works.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using Random Forest Regression,\n",
    "it is important to set expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Random Forest Regression, you should expect:\n",
    "- strong performance on complex and non-linear data\n",
    "- robust predictions even in the presence of noise\n",
    "- less sensitivity to individual outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to simpler models:\n",
    "- Random Forest usually outperforms Linear Regression\n",
    "- it is more stable than KNN on large datasets\n",
    "- it requires less manual feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this power comes at a cost:\n",
    "- the model is harder to interpret\n",
    "- training and prediction are more computationally expensive\n"
