    "## How this notebook should be read\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be read **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not just to run the code,\n",
    "but to understand what is happening at each step\n",
    "and be able to adapt it to your own data.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is Linear Regression? \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, Linear Regression tries to **draw a straight line through the data**\n",
    "in such a way that the line is as close as possible to all data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data point represents:\n",
    "- some input values (features)\n",
    "- a real observed output (target)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model:\n",
    "- places a line (or a plane, or a higher-dimensional surface)\n",
    "- measures how far each data point is from that line\n",
    "- adjusts the line to minimize the overall distance to all points\n",
    "\n",
    "These distances represent prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the line is too high:\n",
    "- predictions are systematically too large\n",
    "\n",
    "If the line is too low:\n",
    "- predictions are systematically too small\n",
    "\n",
    "By minimizing the total error, the model learns the **overall trend** in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the line is learned, the model can:\n",
    "- take new input values\n",
    "- project them onto the learned line\n",
    "- return a predicted output value\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we start with intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the intuition first is important because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the code will directly reflect this idea\n",
    "- every training step is just an automated way of adjusting the line\n",
    "- every prediction is a projection onto that line\n",
    "\n",
    "If this mental model is clear,\n",
    "the rest of the notebook becomes much easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training the model, it is important to set expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Linear Regression, you should expect:\n",
    "- reasonable but not perfect predictions\n",
    "- a simple and interpretable model\n",
    "- performance that captures general trends, not complex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model performs poorly:\n",
    "- it does not necessarily mean something is wrong\n",
    "- it may simply mean the relationship is not linear\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is often used as:\n",
    "- a baseline\n",
    "- a reference point for more complex models\n",
