    "## What is KNN Regression? \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN Regression is a very different model compared to Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of learning a global formula or a line,\n",
    "KNN Regression makes predictions by looking at the data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple:\n",
    "to predict the value for a new data point,\n",
    "the model searches for the **K closest data points**\n",
    "in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these neighbors are found:\n",
    "- their target values are collected\n",
    "- the prediction is computed as the **average** of those values\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no explicit training phase where parameters are learned.\n",
    "The model simply stores the training data\n",
    "and uses it at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, KNN is often described as a\n",
    "**lazy, instance-based model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "## Why we start with intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with intuition is especially important for KNN Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the model does is:\n",
    "- measure distances between data points\n",
    "- decide which points are close\n",
    "- aggregate their target values\n",
    "\n",
    "If this idea is clear,\n",
    "the rest of the notebook becomes easy to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every step in the code will reflect this logic:\n",

    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using KNN Regression, it is important to set expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With KNN Regression, you should expect:\n",
    "- predictions that adapt locally to the data\n",
    "- good performance when similar data points exist nearby\n",
    "- sensitivity to noise and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "This model often performs well as a flexible alternative\n",
    "when linear assumptions are too restrictive,\n",
    "but it may struggle on large datasets or high-dimensional data.\n"

    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning models.\n",

    "At a high level, Linear Regression tries to **draw a straight line through the data**\n",
    "in such a way that the line is as close as possible to all data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data point represents:\n",
    "- some input values (features)\n",
    "- a real observed output (target)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model:\n",
    "- places a line (or a plane, or a higher-dimensional surface)\n",
    "- measures how far each data point is from that line\n",
    "- adjusts the line to minimize the overall distance to all points\n",
    "\n",
    "These distances represent prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the line is too high:\n",
    "- predictions are systematically too large\n",
    "\n",
    "If the line is too low:\n",
    "- predictions are systematically too small\n",
    "\n",
    "By minimizing the total error, the model learns the **overall trend** in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the line is learned, the model can:\n",
    "- take new input values\n",
    "- project them onto the learned line\n",
    "- return a predicted output value\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we start with intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the intuition first is important because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the code will directly reflect this idea\n",
    "- every training step is just an automated way of adjusting the line\n",
    "- every prediction is a projection onto that line\n",
    "\n",
    "If this mental model is clear,\n",
    "the rest of the notebook becomes much easier to follow.\n",

    "- reasonable but not perfect predictions\n",
    "- a simple and interpretable model\n",
    "- performance that captures general trends, not complex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model performs poorly:\n",
    "- it does not necessarily mean something is wrong\n",
    "- it may simply mean the relationship is not linear\n",
    "\n",

    "- a baseline\n",
