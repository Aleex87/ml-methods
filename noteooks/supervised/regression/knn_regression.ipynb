    "This notebook is designed to be read **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not just to run the code,\n",

    "## What is KNN Regression? \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN Regression is a very different model compared to Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of learning a global formula or a line,\n",
    "KNN Regression makes predictions by looking at the data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple:\n",
    "to predict the value for a new data point,\n",
    "the model searches for the **K closest data points**\n",
    "in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these neighbors are found:\n",
    "- their target values are collected\n",
    "- the prediction is computed as the **average** of those values\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no explicit training phase where parameters are learned.\n",
    "The model simply stores the training data\n",
    "and uses it at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, KNN is often described as a\n",
    "**lazy, instance-based model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "## Why we start with intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with intuition is especially important for KNN Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the model does is:\n",
    "- measure distances between data points\n",
    "- decide which points are close\n",
    "- aggregate their target values\n",
    "\n",
    "If this idea is clear,\n",
    "the rest of the notebook becomes easy to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every step in the code will reflect this logic:\n",
    "distance → neighbors → average → prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using KNN Regression, it is important to set expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With KNN Regression, you should expect:\n",
    "- predictions that adapt locally to the data\n",
    "- good performance when similar data points exist nearby\n",
    "- sensitivity to noise and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "This model often performs well as a flexible alternative\n",
    "when linear assumptions are too restrictive,\n",
    "but it may struggle on large datasets or high-dimensional data.\n"
