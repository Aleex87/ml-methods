    "# Deep Learning – Classification (scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of the **ML-Methods** project.\n",
    "\n",
    "It introduces **Deep Learning for supervised classification**\n",
    "using the scikit-learn implementation of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the other classification notebooks,\n",
    "the first sections focus on data preparation\n",
    "and are intentionally repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures consistency across models\n",
    "and allows fair comparison of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",

    "## Notebook Roadmap (standard ML-Methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Project setup and common pipeline  \n",
    "2. Dataset loading  \n",
    "3. Train-test split  \n",
    "4. Feature scaling (why we do it)  \n",

    "## How this notebook should be read\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be read **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before every code cell, you will find a short explanation describing:\n",
    "- what we are about to do\n",
    "- why this step is necessary\n",
    "- how it fits into the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not just to run the code,\n",
    "but to understand how **deep learning models**\n",
    "fit into the supervised learning pipeline\n",
    "and how they differ from classical machine learning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Deep Learning (in this context)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning refers to a class of models\n",
    "based on **neural networks with multiple layers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are designed to:\n",
    "- learn complex, non-linear relationships\n",
    "- automatically build internal representations\n",
    "- go beyond hand-crafted features\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on:\n",
    "**Deep Learning for tabular data**\n",
    "using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use scikit-learn for Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn provides a **high-level abstraction**\n",
    "for neural networks through `MLPClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to:\n",
    "- focus on concepts rather than low-level details\n",
    "- reuse the same pipeline as classical ML models\n",
    "- understand *what* deep learning does\n",
    "  before learning *how* it is implemented internally\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook acts as a **conceptual bridge**\n",
    "between classical machine learning\n",
    "and full deep learning frameworks\n",
    "such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should expect from the results\n",
    "\n",
    "With Deep Learning (scikit-learn), you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "- improved performance on complex patterns\n",
    "- higher sensitivity to feature scaling\n",
    "- longer training times compared to linear models\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- interpretability is lower\n",
    "- hyperparameter tuning becomes more important\n",
    "- the model behaves as a black box\n",
    "\n",
