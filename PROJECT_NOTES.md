  - difference between classification and regression
  - normalization is used some time in deep learning (standardization not)
  - Confusion Matrix explanation (cats vs dogs example)
  - difference between overfitting and underfitting 
  - Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
  - sklearn vs PyTorch vs TensorFlow
  - Real-world data loading with pd.read_csv("...")
